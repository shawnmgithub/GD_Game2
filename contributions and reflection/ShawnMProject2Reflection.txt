For our second project in the game development course, we were tasked with creating a simple mobile game. Unfortunately, we did not enjoy this project as much as our first due to the shorter time frame for idea development and overall production. We completed everything within a two-week period, and used Trello.com and Discord for project management and communication. Our team consisted of an artist, a designer, and two programmers, one of whom was myself. The artist and designer were in charge of acquiring and creating assets(all acquired assets were open source, created by the artist for this project, or purchased through Unity). The programmers were in charge of making the assets function how we wanted them to.


In this project, I was responsible for the player controls. This included the implementation of a score tracker that counted the player's overall score and current streak, as well as the functionality of tapping notes to remove them from the game and add to the score. However, we encountered issues with the game over function and the red notes, which were supposed to be draggable and disappear upon contact with another note for points. These are issues that I plan to work on independently to improve the game.


Despite the challenges we faced in this project, I believe it provided valuable experience in participating and contributing to a team. We managed to produce a working product, even if all of the features we intended to implement were not fully functional. This also gives me the opportunity to go back and work on the project independently to fix issues and add additional features. Additionally, I was impressed by the professionalism and quality of the background and notes, which were created by our artist and game designer. I also enjoyed collaborating with the other programmer to troubleshoot and solve problems.
